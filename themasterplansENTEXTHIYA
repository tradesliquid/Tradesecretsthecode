the following documents are rules plans and entries stops and targets for various strategies these are here to help you 
decide which strategies should get which rules entries and exits.

Tracy’s Swing/Day Trading Plan 
Revised May 1, 2021 next revision not allowed until September 1, 2021 
Entries (Offensive) 
Set Up’s 
#1 Hammer Candle / Inverted Hammer Candle (reverse everything)– 
● Prefer tail to break a support and body close above support. 
● Regardless of ^^, hammer MUST be at a support. 
● Stock should be in an uptrend. 
● 78 Min chart or a daily chart 
● IF price is above the 100 EMA, RSI must be below 50 
● IF price is below the 100 EMA, RSI must be below 40 
● IF stock is moving sideways, hammer MUST be at the bottom of the channel. 
● In all cases PREFERENCE goes to a bearish hammer with high volume. 
● In all cases PREFERENCE goes to a hammer with a small upper tail. 
#2 Dip buy/sell on pull-backs 
● Allowed if with trend. 
● Buy/sell off support/resistance IF pull-back volume is reducing and support/resistance is within the top 50% of the move. 
#3 Volume Profile Trades (Discretionary Trading) 
● Discretionary trading allowed here 
● Signals I am looking for are: type of interaction with prior day value area. 
● Trend days are most profitable and the days I am looking to trade most. They are least likely to occur if we remain inside prior value. 
● Trade with the statistics of the IB 
● Look for setups #1 and #2 but also look for absorption and exhaustion. Entry does NOT have to be off a candle but rather a level. 
#4 Pyramid Trading 
● Stock MUST be in an uptrend. 
● Establish the size of the biggest pullback on the stock that interests you. 
● Mark the pullback from the high. 
● Mark a line at the pullback location. 
● Add a profile for the range above that line. 
● Mark 3 or 4 locations based on the profile. 
#5 Absolute Zero Trades 
● When stocks of interest are NOT in an uptrend use absolute zero plays… You can add to the position as it starts trending up and as it breaks through resistance.
Support/Resistance is defined: 
● Daily 10 or 20 EMA, 50, 100 or 200 SMA 
● 78 min 100 or 200 EMA or SMA 
● Obvious horizontal support levels preferred from higher time frames 
● Prior day lows, Prior pivots, Trend Lines, POC, Value area, VWAP 
Entry #1: Stop limit above/below the high/low of the hammer candle/inverted hammer candle. Stop below/above min 2 levels of support/resistance. 
Entry #2: Limit entries at the support/resistance IF prior move to that support/resistance is made with decreasing volume. Stop below/above min 2 levels of support/resistance.. 
Entry #3: Enter with Limit or Stop Limit as close to support/resistance as possible. Stop below/above min 2 levels of support/resistance. 
Management: 
● CANCEL trade if the low of the hammer is broken before the trade is triggered. Hammer is still in play as long as there is not a CLOSE below the low of that hammer. Reassess and either set up a new trade or wait for a new signal. 
● Partials should be taken at new highs or at resistance areas. Resistance areas are considered, trend lines, pivots, POC’s, or after 3+ bull candles in a row, round numbers on price (ex $250.00, $260.00, $270.00), high volume nodes, value area highs/lows. 
● IF 10 EMA is below 20 EMA: 
○ Stop can be moved on a break below 1st support level, move stop up directly below 2nd level of support. 
● IF 10 EMA is above the 20 EMA 
○ Stop moves should happen after a close below the 10 EMA but move to the most recent pivot. 
○ Stop moves should happen after a close below the 20 EMA to right under the closing candle. 
● You’ll either scale out or trail out. 
● When ranging inside of prior value area, take larger partials and/or all at targets rather than trying to hold. 


another sample trading plan

Trading Plan
•	Morning Routine
•	Pray, read, and recite affirmations
•	Review trading plan and daily goals
•	Formulate a daily bias
•	What is the market doing?
•	If the market is an inside day - look to take profits quicker/bigger partials
•	Pre-market scanning
•	Trade Ideas, Barcharts, daily watchlists
•	Finalize watchlist
•	Visualize how you want your day to go 
•	Trade Management Rules
•	If skipped or missed by pennies – move entry to get a better retest entry or cancel
•	If a trade hits a target before I get filled - cancel or readjust
•	I can play early defense on my trade if
•	It traps me within the close of the next candle after being triggered in
•	I see a volume break and it wicks to trap that break
•	I see a high volume pivot point 
•	Early defense is defined by any or a combination of the following
•	Trailing stop aggressively
•	Marketing out 10%
•	Flattening the trade
•	Targets
•	Take a partial at 1R or a support/resistance if it is close to my 1R level, sell remaining at my original 2R
•	I can only shoot for more than 2R if it was an amazing gap that trapped multiple days of price action and good volume and the trade worked in my favor quickly
•	I can take all between 1R and 2R if
•	I planned to before setting up the trade (ex I saw a good resistance level at 1.6R)
•	Testing VWAP from the bottom
•	I am not over 4R pure day trades yet for the month and I see a reason to stack the gain (early defense, or hitting a resistance/support level)
•	It is the last week of the month and I want to pad the month's gains
•	Partials are 10-50% of the position 
•	When price barely misses my target I can
•	Market out 10%
•	Increase my target
•	Move stop to pivot after the stock has reached 1R target
•	Increase stops to pivots as needed depending on the overall movement
•	Consider finding a pivot that ensures the trade is a winner if I see a "early defense" sign
•	When up 3R closed for the day you can choose to quit or continue to take ONE more trade if a quality idea is found
•	Max loss is 3R per day
•	Personal strategies
•	Only trade SPY/QQQ if the whole market is trading in sync, there is a good gap on the SPY/QQQ, or there is some external driver (fed news, trump, etc)
•	Focus on the best 1-2 gaps of the day first, then look at the chart for
•	highwave breakout/breakdown
•	retest into big opening candle
•	LOD/HOD trap bo/bd
•	consolidation bo/bd- especially if it can poke through VWAP first 
•	Trendline break
•	Afternoon rollover on high volume reversal 
•	birdbox
•	High volume hammers
•	Sammy (VWAP and 10 ema squeeze without ext hours)
•	RSI Divergence
•	RLT's specific trading plan
•	Combinations of the above are even better especially with volume
•	Remember that strategies go through rotations - keep in mind what has been working and what has not throughout the month
•	If something has not been working - be more picky - require multiple signals
•	Weaknesses to work on
•	Intraday trend following 
•	I like to see a nice big S curve and there are a lot of times where the S curve is pretty shallow
•	Being too patient early in the month or early in the day
•	Don't be afraid to stack smaller gains early in the month
•	Don't be afraid to be aggressive with taking profits with the early morning trades



Rules for Trading Debit Spreads
1.	Low IV (IV Rank below 20)
2.	Check the liquidity of the options
a.	Volume - look for activity on most strikes, especially near the money
b.	Open Interest - I would like to see at least one line with 1k or more, any zeros here is not great
c.	Check the Bid/Ask spread - ideally it is around 10% or less
3.	Choose an Expiration Cycle
a.	 45-60 Days to Expiration
4.	Choose your strikes
a.	To start: Place the short strike on the line with the most Extrinsic Value available
b.	Then set a width, I usually start with around $5 or $10 wide and then adjust
5.	Check the Math Metrics
a.	Positive Theta
b.	POP over 50%
c.	I am ALWAYS selling more extrinsic value than I am buying!
6.	I try to pay around 50% of the width of the strikes or less, if I can
a.	I never pay ⅗	 the width or more for example:
i.	I don’t do $3 for a $5
ii.	I don’t do $6 for a $10
7.	For the number of contracts - Stay under or around 3% of your account value (or less if you need to)
8.	Once you fill the trade, Set a GTC order for 35% of max profit
a.	To figure out your target you need to subtract your debit from the width of the spread to figure out your max profit 
i.	(ei. $10-$4.80 if you pay $4.80 for a $10 wide spread = $5.20 max profit)
b.	Multiply the max profit by .35 (ei. 5.20 x .35 = 1.82)
c.	Add the profit target amount to your debit paid (ei $4.80 + $1.82 = ~$6.62)
9.	At 21 days to expiration, close the trade if you did not fill the GTC


1.	Low IV is helpful but not required
2.	Buy a leap anywhere from 9 months to a year out in time. Usually at the money (1 st strike in)
3.	Sell a .20-.30 delta short call against the leap in the next 45-60 day expiration cycle. Make sure that regardless of delta your covered call is sold ABOVE the strike price of your leap.
4.	Management
a.	Roll the short Call 21 days to expiration consistently but only for a credit.
b.	You can also roll the short call early if it is getting tested but make sure you are still getting a credit
c.	Try to roll further away from the money while still getting a credit - if you cannot then rolling straight across is fine as long as you don’t hold to expiration
d.	Never roll “down” or closer to the money in this style of trade
e.	Hedge over earnings by reducing the delta by around 50%
5.	The trade should always be showing positive theta
6.	Plan to sell everything (all legs of the entire position) at new all time highs OR 60 days to expiration of the long leaps
7.	Position size can very, but typically you will be committing more than a small amount of your account to this “Long term” position trade (10% or more in most cases)



1.	Entry requirement for chart with bullish sentiment
a.	Price must be above 200 SMA on Daily
b.	Price must be below 200 SMA on Hourly
2.	Targets
a.	Credit Spreads
i.	50% of the credit received (max profit)
b.	Debit Spreads
i.	35% of the max profit
3.	If the GTC order does not fill by 21 days to the expiration of the options OR if I have a credit spread where the short strike is getting tested, then I will manage early
a.	If I am profitable I close the trade
b.	If I am down
i.	Credit Spreads - I will try to roll for a credit
1.	If I cannot get a credit to roll out in time, then I will close the trade for a loss - *if you don’t like the idea of rolling, then just close the trade at 21 days to expiration
ii.	Debit Spreads - I close the trade
4.	 I DO NOT hold spreads over earnings. Which is why, when I place new trades, I don’t like to see earnings within two weeks at least of the date.


Credit Spread Checklist
1.	Check for Binary Events
2.	Check the IV Rank
a.	IF IVR is at or above 30 - Selling spreads is great!
b.	If IVR is between 20- 30 - Be careful, and be picky on the premium
c.	If IVR is under 20 - Do not sell a credit spread
3.	Check the liquidity of the options
a.	Volume - look for activity on most strikes, especially near the money
b.	Open Interest - I would like to see at least one line with 1k or more, any zeros here is really not great
c.	Check the Bid/Ask spread - ideally it is around 10% or less
4.	Choose an Expiration Cycle
a.	45-60 days - I usually trade monthly cycles
5.	Choose a short strike to start with
a.	Math Based optimal is .30 delta
6.	Check the Math Metrics
a.	Positive Theta
b.	POP over 50%
   		c. I am ALWAYS selling more extrinsic value than I am buying
7.	Evaluate premium for good risk/reward
a.	Always get 1/3rd the width of your strikes
b.	Example - If you sell a $10 wide credit spread, you should get paid at least $3.33 or more
8.	Select the proper number of contracts to sell
a.	Between 3-5% of your net liq
9.	Once you fill the order - IMMEDIATELY set a GTC order for 50% premium capture (50% of max profit)



Credit Spread Checklist
1.	Check for Binary Events
2.	Check the IV Rank
a.	IF IVR is at or above 30 - Selling spreads is great!
b.	If IVR is between 20- 30 - Be careful, and be picky on the premium
c.	If IVR is under 20 - Do not sell a credit spread
3.	Check the liquidity of the options
a.	Volume - look for activity on most strikes, especially near the money
b.	Open Interest - I would like to see at least one line with 1k or more, any zeros here is really not great
c.	Check the Bid/Ask spread - ideally it is around 10% or less
4.	Choose an Expiration Cycle
a.	45-60 days - I usually trade monthly cycles
5.	Choose a short strike to start with
a.	Because you are getting paid on both sides, I like to start around then .20 delta and adjust as needed
b.	If you are going with a naked strangle, I usually prefer the .16 delta
6.	Evaluate premium for good risk/reward
a.	Always get 1/3rd the width of your strikes
b.	Example - If you sell a $10 wide credit spread, you should get paid at least $3.33 or more
7.	Select the proper number of contracts to sell
a.	Between 3-5% of your net liq
8.	Once you fill the order - IMMEDIATELY set a GTC order for 50% premium capture (50% of max profit)
a.	Although, with IC’s because of their non-directional nature, they can sometimes move more slowly. If you want to walk away at 35% or 40% capture and move on, I think that is fine.
9.	As a general rule for ALL spread trading - “What goes on as a spread, goes OFF as a spread.”
10.	Management
a.	Target is a 50% gtc order
b.	If the GTC order does not fill by 21 days to the expiration of the options OR if I have a credit spread where the short strike is getting tested, then I will manage early
i.	If I am profitable I close the trade
ii.	If I am down, I will try to roll for a credit and/or roll the untested side
iii.	If I cannot get a credit to roll out in time, then I will close the trade for a loss - *if you don’t like the idea of rolling, then just close the trade at 21 days to expiration
iv.	Method for rolling an IC
1.	Setup order to roll the TESTED side, it will probably be a debit, so get that price
2.	Setup order to roll the UNTESTED side, it should be a healthy credit, ideally more than the debit of the first order, if it is not enough, roll down on your strikes by one
3.	Then ship the tested side order and make sure you get enough credit to pay for the debit
11.	If doing these over earnings, I always take the trade off the next day if I win. If we get an outside move and I am down on the trade, I will manage the spread as outlined above.


Trade setups I have used with math based options strategies:
1.	10 EMA - either debit or credit depending on IV
a.	Make sure you have good liquidity
2.	I don't use this with Momo unless I am using a ratio spread, or very large debit
3.	I sell put spreads in good companies on down days (try matt delongs put sale indicator on your watchlist) - given good IV Rank
4.	It’s not a sin to follow the official swing trades, but with math based options!!
5.	I do swing trading with my FINVIZ scan and the hourly chart (200 sma)
6.	I do a lot of pyramid trading.
a.	I pick stocks based on my FINVIZ scan and a tool called Simply Wall St
7.	DOES NOT APPLY TO MATH BASED OPTIONS - 
a.	I day trade AMD



1.	R = 200 
2.	Max loss 2R per day, 5R per week, 10R per Month. 
3.	When I go up +4Rs in the first 30 minutes, be done for the day.
4.	When I go up +6Rs by 9am be done for the day.
5.	I only focus on weekly options stocks search for Good Gaps 
6.	Analyze stocks write down possible setups for day. Daily (2 yrs. data), gap type, hourly(support/resistance), 15min(support/resistance), use 5-min and 3-min chart for your entries. Track VOLUME 
7.	Plan trades ahead of time. Look for breakout setups premarket and set trade up. When no premarket setups wait 20 min to find entry.
8.	When playing the retest gap wait for MSR ESR HAMMER OR HIGH WAVE. 
9.	See 3+ candles of the same color in a row, do not take a breakout. 
10.	DO NOT CHASE THE TRADE!!!!
11.	when in trade for up to 90 min and profitable look to exit. If at 2R around 60 min exit for 2R
12.	if not profitable after 90min look to lose small
13.	On a Bullish GNG when first 5-min candle is HIGH WAVE (bear indecision) with no resistance premarket, enter above the high stop below the low of candle
14.	EXIT LOSERS FAST 
15.	I will raise my R $50 if I make 10R for 3 months in a row
16.	Pick two days to not trade each month. 6 trades max per day

PAIN If I break a rule at any time,100 burpees 30 days in a row. 
PLEASURE if I reach at least 10R on the month Fancy dinner for me

ENTRIES
SWING TRADE SPREADS (CURRENT WEEK EXPIRATION)
-NEED TO HAVE 2 BARRIERS IN BETWEEN STRIKE AND CURRENT PRICE, DETEMINE THESE LEVELS BEFORE ENTERING SPREAD
-MUST CHECK THE NEWS FROM 3 SOURCES, TO ENSURE THAT NO MAJOR REPORTS, OR MAJOR EVENTS ARE OCCURING FOR THAT COMPANY WITHIN THE TIME OF YOUR CREDIT SPREADS. 

          -SELL ONLY .20 DELTA AND LOWER
        -CHECK EARNINGS DATE (do not sell spreads the week of their earnings, to risky)


SET UP 1- IF  YOU SELL IT RIGHT AT A LEVEL OF SUPPORT/RESISTANCE ( BETTER PREMIUM BUT HARDER TO HEDGE.)
SET UP 2- IF  YOU SELL IT ABOVE/ BELLOW THE LEVEL( LESS PREMIUM BUT EASIER TO HEDGE AND MORE PROTECTED) 
EXAMPLE BELLOW IS OF A BULL PUT SPREAD, SAME CONCEPT APPLIES TO BEAR CALL SPREADS
 


SWING TRADE SPREADS (CURRENT WEEK EXPIRATION)
MANAGE POSITIONS
Only take positions that will allow you to hedge long before it gets to your strike. Set up an alert at the level that you are wrong, If it closes across that level then purchase  enough long options so that you will be profitable (long protection options will be worth more than what your spread is losing) by the time the price reaches your sold strike of the credit spread.

-PROFIT TAKING- EXIT ENTIRE SPREAD FOR A PROFIT IF UP MORE THAN 70% PREMIUM CAPTURE, DO NOT HOLD UNTIL FRIDAY TO LET IT EXPIRE WORTHLESS. TO MUCH RISK, AND NO NEED TO TIE UP BUYING POWER ALL WEEK. YOU WILL MAKE MORE MONEY BY CLOSING OUT TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY, AND ENTERING ANOTHER SPREAD TO CLOSE OUT BY THURSDAY. 90% OF MY SPREADS HIT MY 70% PREMIUM CAPTURE TARGET THE VERY NEXT DAY.
-MUST HAVE 2 BARRIERS FOR IT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH, FIRST BARRIER IS THE CONCERN ZONE/ SECOND IS THE ALERT ZONE.   


SEE DESCRIPTION OF  SET UP 1 AND 2 ABOVE UNDER ENTRIES. 
SET UP 1-  IF ALARM GOES OFF, BUY PROTECTION IF IT CLOSES WITH A 30 MIN CANDLE ABOVE/BELLOW YOUR ALERT LEVEL. YOU CAN WAIT FOR A PULLBACK TO THE ALERT LEVEL TO ENTER THE PROTECTION, OR JUST PURCHASE IT WITH A CLOSE OF THE 30 MIN CANDLE. Your choice, but I usually try to get in on a pullback. EXIT THE PROTECTION WITH A CLOSE OF A 15 MIN CANDLE  BACK ACROSS YOUR ALERT LEVEL. ( YOU WILL LOSE MONEY ON THE PROTECTION IF THIS HAPPENS. DO NOT LOSE MORE THAN HALF OF THE PREMIUM YOU RECEIVED FOR THE SPREAD )IF IT CONTIMUES TOWARD YOUR SPREAD AND HITS YOUR  CREDIT SPREAD SOLD STRIKE, EXIT YOUR LONG OPTIONS FOR A PROFIT.  GIVE IT A DAY AND SEE HOW IT REACTS, BEFORE CLOSINGYOUR SPREAD. SEE IF IT HOLDS THE LEVEL THAT YOU SOLD THE SPREAD AT. CLOSE IF IT HITS YOUR PURCHASE STRIKE OF THE CREDIT SPREAD, THAT SAME DAY. THE NEXT DAY CLOSE IF IT CLOSES ON 10 MIN ACROSS YOUR STRIKE. YOUR LONG PROTECTION SHOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN YOUR LOSSES OF YOUR SPREAD. YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO CLOSE OUT EVERYTHING ON THE FIRST DAY, IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO RISK HOLDING THE SPREAD OVERNIGHT.

SET UP 2- IF ALARM GOES OFF, BUY PROTECTION IF IT CLOSES WITH A 15 MIN CANDLE ABOVE/BELLOW YOUR ALERT LEVEL. YOU CAN WAIT FOR A PULLBACK TO THE ALERT LEVEL TO ENTER THE PROTECTION, OR JUST PURCHASE IT WITH A CLOSE OF THE 15 MIN CANDLE. Your choice, but I usually try to get in on a pullback. . EXIT THE PROTECTION WITH A CLOSE OF A 10 MIN CANDLE  BACK ACROSS YOUR ALERT LEVEL. ( YOU WILL LOSE MONEY ON THE PROTECTION IF THIS HAPPENS. DO NOT LOSE MORE THAN HALF OF THE PREMIUM YOU RECEIVED FOR THE SPREAD

 IF IT HITS YOUR SOLD STRIKE OF THE CREDIT SPREAD, UNRAVEL OR EXIT SPREAD.  Don’t exit your spread until it hits your spread with the hedge. You should have made a profit by the time the price hits your sold strike price, then exit all for the profit, but not until it hits your strike price, or you have profited the amount of premium you received. 

-RULES OF HEDGING 
        -ONLY LOOK AT ENTERING A HEDGE IF YOUR ALERT GOES OFF. WHEN THE ALERT IS TRIGGERED  FOLLOW THE SPECIFIC ENTRY RULES ABOVE DEPENDING ON WHAT SET UP YOU SOLD THE SPREAD UNDER. 
         - DETERMINE HOW MUCH IS NEEDED TO HEDGE SO THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO OFFSET LOSES WHEN THE PRICE GOES TO YOUR SOLD STRIKE. . USE THE RISK ANALYSIS TOOL FROM YOUR BROKER TO DETERMINE THIS AMOUNT. 

         - THE MORE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOUR ALERT ZONE AND YOUR CREDIT SPREAD THE BETTER CHANCE YOU HAVE AT GUARANTEEING A WIN. (YOUR MAX LOSS ON THE HEDGED LONG OPTIONS WILL NOT BE MORE THAN THE PROFIT OF THE SPREAD.) 
   - DO NOT LOSE MORE ON THE LONG HEDGE OPTIONS THAN THE CREDIT YOU RECEIVED FROM SELLING THE SPREAD. 
    - DO NOT HOLD HEDGE LONG OPTIONS OVER NIGHT UNLESS THE MAX LOSS IS LESS THAN THE PREMIUM FORM YOUR SPREAD. IF YOUR MAX LOSS IS MORE THAN YOUR CREDIT RECEIVED, THEN EXIT THE AMOUNT OF PROTECTION UNTIL THE MAX LOSS IS LESS THAN CREDIT RECEIVED. THE NEXT DAY IF NEED TO ADD MORE PROTECTION THEN APPLY THE SAME ENTRY RULES THAT WERE USED TO ENTER THE PRTECTION. (WAIT FOR A CLOSE ABOVE / BELLOW THE FIRST 5 MIN CANDLE)
- 90% OF THE TIME IF MY ALERT GOES OFF, THE PRICE WILL GO TO MY STRIKE THAT SAME DAY, FOR ME TO EXIT EVERYTHING. I USUALLY DON’T HAVE TO HOLD PROTECTION OVERNIGHT. 


CONCERN ZONE
IF GAPS OVERNIGHT, OR IF CLOSES ON 30 MIN DURING THE DAY IN THE CONCERN ZONE AND YOUR MORE THAN 50% PROFITABLE TAKE THE PROFIT, OR FIND A LEVEL THAT WILL BECOME YOUR NEW ALERT LEVEL. IF NOT PROFITABLE YET THEN JUST WAIT UNTIL YOUR ORIGNAL ALERT LEVEL IS HIT FOR YOU TO HEDGE, OR WAIT UNTIL YOUR 70% PREMIUM CAPTURE TARGET HAS BEEN FILLED. 





GAPS
REMEMBER YOU ONLY LOSE ON THE SPREAD IF AT THE END OF THE EXPIRATION DAY THE PRICE IS ACROSS YOUR SOLD SPREAD STRIKE. IF THERE ARE STILL A FEW DAYS LEFT BEFORE IT EXPIRES YOU HAVE NOT LOST YET. TRY TO BE PATIENT AND WAIT TO SEE WHAT SENTIMENT FORMS. MOST GAPS OF 3-4% WILL FADE ( GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE GAP) AND NOT CONTINUE IN THE GAP DIRECTION ON THE DAY OF THE GAP. YOU DO NOTHING IF IT GAPS BUT DID NOT CROSS YOUR ALERT LEVEL. REFER BACK TO SECTION OF CENCERN ZONE ABOVE.

IF GAPPED BARELY ACROSS ALERT LEVEL ( <%1 ACROSS ALERT LEVEL) 
IF THE STOCK GAPS OVERNIGHT ACROSS YOUR ALERT LEVEL (APPLIES FOR ENTRY SET UP 1 AND 2) DON’T CLOSE OUT SPREAD YET. GET IN PROTECTION TO HEDGE, AND EXIT ALL WHEN PRICE HITS YOUR SOLD STRIKE OF SPREAD. TO ENTER THE PROTECTION, WAIT FOR THE MARKET TO BE OPEN FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE BUYING PROTECTION. BUY PROTECTION IF THE MARKET CLOSES ABOVE/ BELLOW THE OPENING 5 MIN CANDLE. EXAMPLE, IF YOU SOLD A BULL PUT SPREAD, AND THE MARKET GAPPED DOWN ACROSS YOUR ALERT OVERNIGHT, YOU WOULD WAIT FOR A CLOSE ON THE 5 MIN CHART, BELLOW THE FIRST 5 MIN CANDLE BEFORE BUYING PUTS TO HEDGE. DETERMINE HOW MANY PUTS TO BUY BY USING YOUR SOFTWARE TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT NEEDED THAT WOULD MAKE YOU PROFITABLE IF THE PRICE REACHED YOUR SOLD STRIKE OF YOUR SPREAD.  EXIT THE PROTECTION FOR A LOSS IFD IT CLOSES BACK ABOVETHE FIRST 5 MIN CANDLE. SEE EXAMPLE BELLOW.
 


GAPS MORE THAN 1% ACROSS YOUR ALERT LEVEL BUT NOT YET TO YOUR SPREAD.

OPTION 1- SAME AS ABOVE-   DON’T CLOSE OUT SPREAD YET. GET IN PROTECTION TO HEDGE, AND EXIT ALL WHEN PRICE HITS YOUR SOLD STRIKE OF SPREAD. TO ENTER THE PROTECTION, WAIT FOR THE MARKET TO BE OPEN FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE BUYING PROTECTION. BUY PROTECTION IF THE MARKET CLOSES ABOVE/ BELLOW THE OPENING 5 MIN CANDLE. EXAMPLE, IF YOU SOLD A BULL PUT SPREAD, AND THE MARKET GAPPED DOWN ACROSS YOUR ALERT OVERNIGHT, YOU WOULD WAIT FOR A CLOSE ON THE 5 MIN CHART, BELLOW THE FIRST 5 MIN CANDLE BEFORE BUYING PUTS TO HEDGE. DETERMINE HOW MANY PUTS TO BUY BY USING YOUR SOFTWARE TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT NEEDED THAT WOULD MAKE YOU PROFITABLE IF THE PRICE REACHED YOUR SOLD STRIKE OF YOUR SPREAD.  EXIT THE PROTECTION FOR A LOSS IFD IT CLOSES BACK ABOVETHE FIRST 5 MIN CANDLE.
OPTION 2- BE A LITTLE MORE PATIENT, WAIT 30 MINUTES TO SEE IF POSSIBLITY OF A FADE COULD OCCUR. IF IT IS NOT ABLE TO HOLD LEVELS AND MOVES AGAINST YOU, THEN BUY PROTECTION WHEN IT BREAKS THE LOW/ HIGH OF THE DAY AGAINST YOU. 
OPTION 3-  DO NOTHING TO PROTECT YOURSELF FOR THE DAY OF THE GAP AND WAIT AND SEE HOW MUCH STRENGTH IS THERE TO PRETECT YOU. ( IF GAPPED DOWN DID BUYERS COME IN THROUGH OUT THE DAY TO BUY IT UP? OR DID IT JUST CONTINUE LOWER)  THEN FORM A GAME PLAN FOR THE NEXT DAY. EXAMPLE, BUY PROTECTION TO HEDGE IF WE TAKE OUT THE LOW/ HIGH OF THE DAILY CANDLE OF THE GAP (PREVIOUS DAY). OR JUST EXIT THE SPREAD FOR A LOSS IF THE PRICE CONTINUES AGAINST YOU AND HITS YOUR SOLD STRIKE OF THE SPREAD. OR GIVE IT ONE MORE DAY TO SEE IF IT STARTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR SPREAD. 
THURSDAY IS THE LATEST YOU CAN HOLD A SPREAD, DO NOT HOLD OVER NIGHT THE NIGHT BEFORE DAY OF EXPIRATION. CLOSE OUT SPREAD BY THE END OF THE DAY THURSDAY, PROFITABLE OR NOT. IF GAPS AGAINST YOU OVER NIGHT YOU WILL HAVE CHANCE OF LSING THE MAX AMOUNT OF THE SPREAD ON FRIDAY. 


GAPPED TO YOUR SPREAD OR PAST IT
THIS IS WORST CASE SCENARIO.
OPTION 1- WAIT ATLEAST 10 MINUTES TO SEE IF THE MARKET WILL FADE AND MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR STRIKE. IF IT DOES, THEN KEEP SPREAD OPEN, AND PLAN TO EXIT THE SPREAD IF IT RETURNS AND HITS YOUR SOLD STRIKE. IF DOES NOT RETURN TO HIT YOUR STRIKE KEEP THE SPREAD OPEN FOR THE DAY AND OVERNIGHT ( AS LONG AS ITS NOT THURSDAY NIGHT TO FRIDAY) UNTIL YOU CAN EXIT FOR A PROFIT, OR UNTIL IT PULLS BACK TO YOUR SOLD STRIKE OF THE SPREAD. IT IS TO LATE TO BE ABLE TO BUY PROTECTION IN THIS SCENARIO.
OPTION 2- DO A REVERSE PROTECTION PLAN. EXAMPLE- IF YOU SOLD A BULL PUT SPREAD, AND OVER NIGHT IT GAPPED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR STRIKE, WAIT FOR THE MARKET TO BE OPEN FOR 10 MIN, IF IT STARTS TO FADE AND MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR STRIKE BUY CALLS TO MAKE MONEY AS IT FADES FOR THE DAY. AS IT MOVES BULLISH AWAY FROM YOUR SPREAD YOUR LONG CALLS WILL MAKE MONEY AND YOUR CREDIT SPREAD LOSSES WILL DECREASE, WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE CALLS ARE WORTH MORE THAN WHAT YOU ARE LOSING ON YOUR SPREAD CLOSE OUT EVERYTHING FOR BREAK EVEN OR A PROFIT IF POSSIBLE. IF FADES BUT THEN PULLS BACK TO YOUR STRIKE EXIT EVERYTHING ( LONG CALLS AND YOUR SPREAD) YOU WILL LOSE MORE MONEY BECAUSE YOU WILL BE LOSING FORMYOUR LONG CALLS AS WELL AS YOUR SPREAD. TRY TO BUY THE CALLS AS CLOSE TO A STRONG LEVEL AS POSSIBLE SO YOU CAN KNOW IF THAT LEVEL IS BROKEN TO EXIT YOUR LONG CALLS..   VISE VERSA FOR SELLING A BEAR CALL SPREAD. YOU WOULD BUY LONG PUTS AND RIDE THEM DOWN AS THE PRICE MOVES AWAY FROM YOUR SPREAD.  
IF GAPPED PAST YOUR SOLD STRIKE OF THE SPREAD, YOU CAN DO OPTION 2 IF IT STARTS TO FADE, OR JUST CLOSE OUT SPREAD AND TAKE THE LOSS.  ON AVERAGE, IT HAS GAPPED PAST MY SPREAD ONCE EVERY 7- 12 MONTHS.

Week 5 Mentorship with Dustin Drummond
10/20 EMA Bounce Strategy (Day Trading)
Pre-trading prep:
1.	Confirm long-term daily/weekly trend and record in log
2.	Confirm the short-term trend on the 30m, 1 hr, 65m or 78m chart and record in log
3.	Draw at least 3 support/resistance lines on chart
4.	No trades for first 15 minutes
Long Setup and Entry:
1.	10 EMA > 20 EMA and 10 EMA > 50 EMA and 20 EMA > 50 EMA (rainbow)
2.	Low < 10 EMA and Close > 10 EMA
3.	Close > VWAP
4.	“Big Wick Candle” wicks are larger than body or hammer candle
5.	Bonus if the low also breaks, touches or comes close to the 20 EMA
6.	Only take the first bounce in a series (if any EMAs cross the series resets)
7.	Stop Limit Entry above high (with buffer)
Long Stops, Targets and Trailing Stops:
1.	Initial Stop should be below the low with a “buffer” and preferably below the 20 EMA or at least halfway between 10 EMA and 20 EMA
2.	Trail Stops after first pivot and trade is “Green” with Normal Conditional Stops
3.	After trade hits 2R profit Trail Stops with Aggressive Conditional Stops
4.	If trade goes “Green” to “Red” to “Green” then trail stop up as high as possible preferably above entry (support/resistance, Normal Conditional Stop or Aggressive Conditional Stop)
5.	If counter trend set a 2R target max (Pre-trading Prep)
6.	If a reversal candle (highwave, doji, hammer…) shows up and RSI > 68 (RSI < 32 for short) tighten stop under low candle with a little buffer (half the previous candle for example) and set target at High + (High - Low)

*** For Short trades just reverse the process but if it is counter trend, the trade should work quickly and if it does not, consider tightening stops and targets or exiting if the trade stalls.

Steps
1.	Identify stocks that tend to move the same direction for one or more weeks at a time.
2.	Find and locate stocks where the 8ema is crossing above (bullish) or below (bearish) the 21 ema on a 78-minute chart.
3.	If the 8ema > 21ema, the indicator will show a GREEN shaded area , be bullish OR if the 21ema > 8ema, the indicator will show a RED shaded area, be bearish.
4.	Buy to open with a “Limit buy” order if a green arrow    is present at CLOSE of a 78-minute candle or sell to open with a “limit sell” or if a red arrow     is present at CLOSE of a 78-minute candle.

2022 Day Trading Strategy

RBLX, HOOD, AMD, TSLA, DAL, NVDA

1)	In order to trade in the first 20 minutes: Stock needs to gap above the prior high of day OR below the prior low of day 
2)	After the first 20 minutes: trade can be placed IF 
a.	Prior day high or low has been taken out 
b.	The stock had a prior day bear candle and we gapped above the open of that candle 
c.	The stock had a prior day bull candle and we gapped below the open of that candle
3)	If gap doesn’t meet one of the above criteria, then cannot trade until 10:30 AM
4)	Using the 3 minute chart for entries
5)	Bear Strategy: Bull candle closing below the 10ema on both the extended and non-extended hours.  Short below that candle, stop above its high and above the moving average
6)	Bull Strategy: Bear candle closing above the 10ema on both extended and non-extended hours.  Long above that candle, stop below its low and below the moving average
7)	The goal is to go long or short at the first candle that meets criteria
8)	Look to exit at:
a.	new high or new low
b.	around 1.2-1.4R
c.	at a previous resistance or support
d.	after 5+ bull candles in a row or 5+ bear candles in a row.
9)	If trade begins to lose in the first 15 minutes of taking it and you are able to exit afterwards for a gain….always take it
10)	If you have two trades in the same direction, both go from winning to losing, back to winning….stack both gains
11)	Can’t cancel trade for 15 minutes once placed
12)	THE BEST TIME for this strategy is after the first hour of market open
13)	This strategy can be flipped if that first trade did not work out, especially if a candle color closes adequately
14)	Can only move stops every 21 minutes

STEP ONE: CHECK FINANCIAL CALENDARS and ECON RELEASES PRIOR TO TRADING DAY SIDE
 NOTE- WORLD MARKET OPENING TIMES
1.	Globex night time session start/opens 3pm pst 6 pm est
2.	Asian Market Opens 5pm pst 8pm est
3.	London Market Opens 12pm pst 3am est
4.	US markets or Cash Open, Opens 6:30am pst 9:30am est


STEP TWO: See STEP ONE check the calendars and what time it is.  Dont get caught with your pants down

STEP THREE: NEVER NEVER NEVER put a trade on with out using the brackets in TV so you have a stop in place.  The futures market moves faster than any other market besides a few cryptos.  NQ is essentially BTC and ES is ETH.  movement wise 
NQ volatile AF ES Yes its volatile during volatile times otherwise steady eddie.

STEP FOUR:  This is your plan 

1.	R = 1000 
2.	Max loss 2 trades per day, 5R per week, 10R per Month. 
3.	When I go up +1.5Rs in the first 30 minutes of the day, be done for the day.
4.	When I go up +2.5Rs by 9am PST be done for the day.
5.	I only focus on NQ, (PIVOT strat). 
6.	Determine TREND FIRST, ALWAYS TRADE WITH THE TREND!!!! for the overall market decide-up down left right sideways see setups next for intraday. When the overall and intraday coincide it makes the decision easy, if they don't good luck. 
7.	Wait for setups at pivots. Check volume, price action, trend(15min intraday)(3hr look at waves)(Daily are we in a bull or bear trend overall), check RSI must be lower than 35 to go long and higher than 65 to go short, and TTM: if looking for longs must be losing momentum to the downside and traveling back to the squeeze or median(midpoint), if looking for shorts must be losing momentum to the upside and traveling back to the squeeze or medium(midpoint). Use 3min for entries off of pivot points and mid pivot levels
8.	Plan trades ahead of time.
9.	If not at or near a pivot do not trade. 
10.	Only trade with the trend 30-50 pt stops. 
11.	If hammer happens at or near pivot level take the setup
12.	GlobeX trades 25 pt targets. Overnight trades target according to price action and pivot levels. During day if pivots are far apart use 75-100 pt targets or next pivot. Once in a trade take partial of 50% when it hits 1R within 10 min. Cannot touch stop for 20 min or move targets once set for 30 min 
13.	When you are in bullish and stock makes a NEW high, sell something… 
14.	EXIT LOSERS FAST
15.	Pick two days to not trade each month. 6 trades max per day
PAIN If I break a rule at any time,100 burpees 30 days in a row. 
PLEASURE if I reach at least 10R on the month fancy food for me
NOTES
Chart Indicators
10 EMA, 50 EMA, Volume, Pivot Points Standard, RSI, TTM by drecken
	Setup
Use pivot point indicator and draw mid piv levels on chart.  Use those levels to determine trade setups.  Always trade with the trend.  Use 15min time frame to determine short term trend. Use daily to determine long term trend. If taking a breakout trade make sure RSI is low volume is above average and TTM is on the low side looking to move up or in a squeeze. When taking reversals make sure RSI is going low into the pivot level and TTM is coming down looking to make a move up make sure volume has increased and the previous candle has wicked into the pivot rather than closed below. When setting up breakdowns and breakouts near pivots look for indecision candles and reversal candles.  When taking the retests of bounces off the pivots be fast do not wait long for the trade to start working if it fails immediately get out fast (during the day side).  When in Globex trades give time to work price action is a lot slower.   

Globex—If price action opens above a pivot level and trades down into it for the first two hours look for a 15min candle to close below the pivot level price action traded into and take a breakout for 25 points back testing has yielded a 90+% win rate when this occurs.
